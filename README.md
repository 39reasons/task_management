# Task Manager App

A task management application built with:

- **Backend**: Apollo Server v5 (GraphQL API) + Express + PostgreSQL  
- **Frontend**: React with Apollo Client + Tailwind CSS  

The app exposes a **GraphQL API** for managing tasks (querying, adding, updating, deleting), and the frontend consumes this API using Apollo Client.
